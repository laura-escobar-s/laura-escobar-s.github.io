I'm Laura Escobar, a PhD student in the linguistics dept. at the University of Toronto. I work on Japanese sociophonetics, mediatized speech, and language and gender. In the department of Italian, Spanish and Portuguese I work with the bilinguals in Toronto lab on grammatical gender acquisition, heritage Spanish and vowel spaces.


#The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
